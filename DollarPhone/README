DollarPhone end point simulator.

The JSON file /u/debit/apps/htdocs/DollarPhone/results.json is used to control the response sent by the simulator.

e.g.

{
 "525553760001" : { "topup":0, "confirm":0 },
 "9734387015" : { "topup":0, "confirm":0, "delay":45 }
}

It is indexed by MSISDN. The topup value indicates the response code to be return for a topup or pin purchase. The confirm filed indicates the response code to return for a transaction status request. The presence of the delay field indicates how may secodes the response should be delayed for.

A Redis server running on devcent702 is used to maintain transaction state. Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. See https://redis.io

The response code used in results.json should be chosen from the table below.
